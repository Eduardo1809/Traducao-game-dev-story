"#00121","Ganhar o Grande Prêmio em o"
"#00122","Global Game Awards."
"#00123","▼Fluxo do game"
"#00124","Primeiro, você vai precisar contratar"
"#00125","alguns funcionários. Você pode"
"#00126","começar a desenvolver um game"
"#00127","para ganhar dinheiro,ou pegar"
"#00128","contratos de trabalho e"
"#00129","focar no treinamento de seus funcionários."

"#00133","Ganhe mais por desenvolvimento"
"#00134","e corrigindo os bugs dos games. Isso"
"#00135","irá aumentar o nível dos seus funcionários"
"#00136","e use os boosts."
"#00137","▼Contratação"
"#00138","Se você fizer um contrato"
"#00139","e se sair bem nele, você vai ganhar dinheiro"
"#00140","e Dados de Pesquisa."
"#00141","É difícil ganhar"
"#00142","dinheiro dessa forma, mas"
"#00143","não requer nenhum capital."
"#00144","▼Desenvolvimento de Games 1"
"#00145","Primeiro, você tem que selecionar um"
"#00146","gênero e tipo de game. A"
"#00147","combinação da mesma"
"#00148","vai ter um grande efeito nas vendas."
"#00149","Você vai precisar de uma licença para"
"#00150","desenvolver para um console."
"#00151","▼Desenvolvimento de Games 2"
"#00152","Depois, você precisa de um"
"#00153","roteirista. You can ask an"
"#00154","employee with scenario"
"#00155","writing experience, or"
"#00156","outsource it. Your choice"
"#00157","affects the game's quality."
"#00158","▼Game Development 3"
"#00159","During development, you'll"
"#00160","also have to add graphics"
"#00161","and sound. You can use"
"#00162","your own staff or outsource"
"#00163","these, but using someone"
"#00164","too often will tire them out."
"#00165","▼Unlocking More Genres"
"#00166","The higher your staff's"
"#00167","job level, the more genres"
"#00168","you can develop in."
"#00169","Genres may also be"
"#00170","unlocked due to the choices"
"#00171","you make in development."
"#00172","▼Unlocking More Types"
"#00173","Depending on a staff"
"#00174","member's job, they may"
"#00175","unlock new game types"
"#00176","during training. Choices"
"#00177","you make in development"
"#00178","can cause types to level up."
"#00179","▼Game Direction 1"
"#00180","When developing a game,"
"#00181","you must choose a game"
"#00182","direction. Even games with"
"#00183","the same genre and type"
"#00184","may sell differently due to"
"#00185","their direction."
"#00186","▼Game Direction 2"
"#00187","This also affects your"
"#00188","company's reputation and"
"#00189","fan base. If a game's genre,"
"#00190","type, and direction match,"
"#00191","you may be able to level up"
"#00192","that genre or type."
"#00193","▼Game Parameters 1"
"#00194","The games you develop all"
"#00195","have a set of parameters:"
"#00196","Fun affects sales, while"
"#00197","Creativity can help make"
"#00198","a hit. Graphics and Sound"
"#00199","are also very important."
"#00200","▼Game Parameters 2"
"#00201","Bugs are a game"
"#00202","developer's worst enemy."
"#00203","Shipping a game with bugs"
"#00204","can lead to big problems."
"#00205","Each time you fix a bug,"
"#00206","you get Research Data."
"#00207","▼Leveling Up Your Staff"
"#00208","You can use Research Data"
"#00209","to level up your staff. This"
"#00210","increases their abilities"
"#00211","across the board, and may"
"#00212","unlock new genres, but it"
"#00213","also increases their salary."
"#00214","▼Staff Parameters 1"
"#00215","■Programming"
"#00216","This is an important all-"
"#00217","around parameter. It affects"
"#00218","development points and"
"#00219","gives bonuses to both"
"#00220","proposals and game art."
"#00221","▼Staff Parameters 2"
"#00222","■Scenario"
"#00223","Aids in getting Research"
"#00224","Data, and makes it easier to"
"#00225","make creative games."
"#00226","▼Staff Parameters 3"
"#00227","■Graphics / Sound"
"#00228","These affect the number of"
"#00229","development points you get."
"#00230","■Energy: Work and training"
"#00231","consume Energy. Staff with"
"#00232","zero Energy will go home."
"#00233","▼Staff Jobs"
"#00234","Each employee has a job,"
"#00235","such as Programmer or"
"#00236","Director. Jobs affect an"
"#00237","employee's parameters and"
"#00238","the genres that may be"
"#00239","unlocked during training."
"#00240","▼Changing Jobs"
"#00241","Using a particular item will"
"#00242","make it possible for a staff"
"#00243","member to change jobs."
"#00244","There are also advanced"
"#00245","jobs that are only open to"
"#00246","staff of level 5 or above."
"#00247","▼Staff Salaries"
"#00248","When you hire an employee"
"#00249","you must pay an initial"
"#00250","contract fee. You must also"
"#00251","pay them a yearly salary at"
"#00252","the end of March. Leveling"
"#00253","up increases staff salaries."
"#00254","▼Company Fans"
"#00255","Your fans are divided into"
"#00256","age groups, and can affect"
"#00257","the sales of your games."
"#00258","Fans age as time passes, so"
"#00259","you'll have to try and appeal"
"#00260","to new young gamers, too."
"#00261","▼Advertising"
"#00262","You can increase your fan"
"#00263","base by advertising, but"
"#00264","some kinds become less"
"#00265","effective over time. Putting"
"#00266","out good games is the best"
"#00267","way to attract more fans."
"#00268","▼Items"
"#00269","You will occasionally be"
"#00270","visited by a salesman who"
"#00271","sells various items that can"
"#00272","improve in-progress games."
"#00273","Some items disappear after"
"#00274","you use them."
"#00275","▼Your Own Console"
"#00276","If your company is large"
"#00277","enough and has a hardware"
"#00278","engineer, you can release"
"#00279","your own console. Use your"
"#00280","fan base to become the king"
"#00281","of the game industry!"
"#00282","▼The Key to Creating a Hit"
"#00283","The combination of genre"
"#00284","and type are very important."
"#00285","Also, sales tend to spike"
"#00286","during the winter holidays,"
"#00287","so the timing of a release"
"#00288","also affects its success."
"#00289","▼Global Game Awards"
"#00290","A number of prizes are"
"#00291","given during these awards,"
"#00292","which are held yearly. If"
"#00293","you get the Grand Prize,"
"#00294","it means that you're one of"
"#00295","the pillars of the industry."
"#00296","▼Ending"
"#00297","The game “ends” after 20"
"#00298","years have passed. Your"
"#00299","total assets at this point will"
"#00300","be saved as your high"

"#00302","continue playing after this."
"#00303","▼Other Notes"

"#00442","Why'd they do this to us?"

"#00444","I got paid to play it, so..."
"#00445","Still needs work."
"#00446","Try again."
"#00447","This shows promise!"
"#00448","Rethink the combination."
"#00449","They worked hard on it."
"#00450","Good job."
"#00451","Needs work, technically."
"#00452","I like this kind of game."
"#00453","It's an interesting idea!"

"#00468","Not bad. But not great."
"#00469","Not for most players."
"#00470","It looked fun."
"#00471","I got really hooked."
"#00472","Rough around the edges."
"#00473","It's pretty well done."
"#00474","So close and yet so far..."
"#00475","They do good work."
"#00476","A bit rough, but creative."
"#00477","Nice. What's next?"
"#00478","They've come a long way."
"#00479","It's a fun combination."
"#00480","Its content was good."
"#00481","I had a lot of fun with it!"
"#00482","A little rough, but good."
"#00483","I give it a “buy.”"
"#00484","Best game of the year."
"#00485","My pick of the week."
"#00486","Good. Could be better."
"#00487","Needs a twist."
"#00488","I could play this for days."
"#00489","Has lots of personality."
"#00490","A guaranteed hit!"
"#00491","I had a ball with this one!"
"#00492","An instant classic!"
"#00493","They did a great job."
"#00494","I play this one every day!"
"#00495","Everybody loved it!"
"#00496","A rare masterpiece!!"
"#00497","I was about to cry!"
"#00498","I can't wait to play more!"
"#00499","Perfect!"
"#00500","It's... so beautiful...!"
"#00501","Amazing! I'm impressed!"
"#00502","This'll go down in history!"
"#00503","A masterpiece!!"
"#00504","The game of the century!"
"#00505","I bought 3 copies myself."
"#00506","An amazingly large game!"
"#00507","Perfect in every way."
"#00508","I'll ask around and see what I can find!/I'll let you know if I hear of any promising candidates."
"#00509","I just took out an ad in a game magazine./We should get a number of applicants soon, so just wait a bit."
"#00510","I took out an ad on an employment website./We should get the results soon."
"#00511","I sent notices to a number of vocational schools./I'll let you know what the results are once I hear back."
"#00512","I just rented out a luxurious ballroom at the Apogee Hotel./We'll conduct a detailed explanation of our company and our games./Afterward, I'll introduce the selected applicants to you."
"#00513","I'm about to jump on a flight to Hollywood to meet with a talent agent./I'm sure we'll be able to find plenty of promising candidates!"
"#00514","Another proposal? I'm not sure I can give this one my best..."
"#00515","I'm doing the graphics again? I'm not sure I can give this one my best..."
"#00516","Another soundtrack? I'm not sure I can give this one my best..."
"#00517","I'm afraid we can't allow a company with no experience to have a license for our console./Why don't you start out by developing some PC games?"
"#00518","That's pretty low...|Let's try to get a better score next time."
"#00519","Those aren't great scores...|But maybe the players won't mind. Let's hope it sells."
"#00520","Those scores are pretty low...|But not everybody listens to the critics. Let's just see if it sells!"
"#00521","Looks like it could've used a bit more work.|But it may sell well, depending on how we promote it!"
"#00522","Those are pretty good scores!|I can't wait to see how well this one sells!"
"#00523","Those are great scores!|Maybe our next game will be in the Hall of Fame!"
"#00524","We almost got in the Hall of Fame!|Scores like this should really help our sales!"
"#00525","It didn't make it into the Hall of Fame...|I guess this will be the last entry in the series..."
"#00526","The alpha version of the current game is now finished. It's time to really start working on the graphics./Who should we put in charge of character design?"
"#00527","The beta version of the current game is now complete. We should start paying attention to the sound now."
"#00528","/You can either choose a designer on your staff, or outsource it to an outside specialist."
"#00529","/You can either choose a sound engineer on your staff, or outsource it to an outside specialist."

"#01065","1 Million Units Sold"
"#01066","The recently released <0> has proven to be quite popular, reaching 1 million units sold in a very short period of time.|But consoles must continue to sell in order to be considered a success.|In many cases, a hit game prompts people to purchase a system.|Indeed, a single hit game can greatly change a console's fortunes."
"#01067","Million-Hit Still Selling"
"#01068","The popular game <0> has now sold more than 1 million units.|This is the first <1> game in some time to reach this mark, and has proved quite popular even with people in the game industry. As one retail store owner put it, “It sells out as soon as we put it on the shelves. I've been playing it to try and discover why it's so popular, and now I'm hooked. Now my sales are suffering...” One can only wonder how many units it will end up selling."

"#01077","New Game Types"
"#01078","We here at Game Guy magazine have recently succeeded in interviewing a famous game developer.|According to him, the best way to increase the number of game types you have available is to train your employees.|Your employees' job types and levels also affect the types of games they can discover.|From what we understand, Scenario Writers are particularly good at discovering new game types, so you may want to try training yours."

"#01083","Masked Man?"
"#01084","According to information acquired by our magazine, a mysterious masked man has recently been seen trying to apply at various video game companies.|Our sources indicate that he is simply a hardworking guy in a mask, so companies should certainly give him a second look."
"#01085","Missing King"
"#01086","A Middle Eastern oil baron disappeared during a recent trip to the consumer electronics district, and hasn't been seen since.|One of his servants looked up from the game he was playing long enough to talk to us. “We knew that the king was obsessed with video games. He kept saying that he wanted to work at a game company, but we didn't think he'd actually try and do it!”"
"#01087","Beast On The Loose"
"#01088","According to one of our reporters, a dangerous wild animal has recently escaped from a forested area in Kairo Park.|While the animal in question has only been sighted from far away, it is said to have long sharp claws and a vicious temperament.

"#01089","A Job For Chimpan Z"
"#01090","We have just learned that Mr. Chimpan Z, a resident of an island on Kairo Park, is looking for employment.|The recent heatwave has apparently decimated the crop of bananas he was tending on the island, leading him to seek work in video game development.|Companies looking for employees may encounter him."

"#01099","Jim Hollingsworth (56)"
"#01100","I used to be a game developer myself in my younger days. Now I just play them, but I had to write in and say how much I enjoyed your latest shooter.|The average company couldn't come close to replicating that kind of perfection...|If I wasn't retired, I'd love to apply for a job at your company, but I guess I'll have to content myself with playing your games."
"#01101","Beverly Kane (25)"
"#01102","I always play your company's games.|I especially enjoyed the trivia game you recently released. I never thought combining it with a <0> would work, but it was perfect!|I can't wait to see what you come up with next."

"#01121","You failed to complete your contracting job.../Your company's reputation has gone down..."
"#01122","The Energy of all of your employees has been restored./You will also receive more Research Data!"
"#01123","/I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here, but I'm afraid that we can't grant a license to a company with such little capital at hand. Why don't you come back when you've grown a bit more?"
"#01124","/Hmm... It looks like you've got enough capital."
"#01125","/All right. I'll give you a license and development kit./I hope you'll develop some games that will help promote our console./Good luck!"
"#01126","Thank you!|I'll do my best from now on as a <0>!"

"#01131","The number of visitors at the <0> booth was <1>."
"#01132","/I'm sure most of those visitors will end up buying our game!/We should definitely go to the show next year, too!"
"#01133","The first half of the development of our console is finished!/Now we will start the second half."
"#01134","Our console is finally finished! Now all we have to do is give it a name and we can ship it./A console made by our company will never go off the market. Plus, you can increase console sales by releasing games for it."
"#01135","<0> years have now passed. This ends the main portion of the game./<1> released <2> games and sold a total of <3> units./The top selling game was|<4>| with total sales of <5>./You can keep playing the game from now on. However, your high score (total capital) will no longer be updated from this point on./If you start a new game, you will be able to start playing using the current levels for game genre and type, which should make it easier to beat your high score next time."
"#01136","But feel free to continue playing your current game to try and beat your top sales record!"
"#01137","I see they've released a new console. After we've built up some capital, we should try getting a license!"
"#01138","They're going to ship a lot of those. It looks like they're really trying to dominate the market. We should try to get in on the action, too!"
"#01139","This seems to be the successor to the popular IES console./We should definitely try and get a license!"
"#01140","This console seems to be focusing on 3D graphics.|They seem to be putting a lot of effort into promoting it. We'll definitely want to keep an eye on this one in the future."
"#01141","This console is being put out by a company best known for its arcade games. I wonder how well it will sell."
"#01142","This one doesn't seem like it will sell very well, and the license fees are very high, too.../But with relatively few companies developing for it, it might be easier to create a hit."
"#01143","This is the successor to the wildly popular PlayStatus console. They said on TV that people have been lining up for days to buy it."
"#01144","This is an impressive console! The license fees are high, but we should think about developing for it!"
"#01145","This console includes some very impressive technology./It's going on sale at the same time throughout the world, so our sales might get a boost!"
"#01146","Apparently you can control this console with a remote, and even use it to access the Internet.../It's unusual, but it might expand the game market to people who wouldn't normally play games!"
"#01147","It's pretty similar to other popular game systems, but there's something a little odd about this one.../Still, the license and development costs are relatively low."
"#01148","Hmm... It doesn't look bad, but I'm not sure it will sell.../Depending on how the market reacts, it might be worth developing for this console."
"#01149","This is a pretty unusual console... But they're going to be shipping a lot of them, so it might be worth developing for."
"#01150","This unique console features many ports of arcade games."
"#01151","Apparently you look through those goggles to see a three-dimensional image.../I'm not sure this one will sell very well..."
"#01152","This is the first portable game console! I bet it'll be especially popular with younger players!"
"#01153","This is a portable console with a color LCD screen./The portable game market is about to expand!"
"#01154","This cutting edge portable console has an impressive number of developers lined up!/We should really think about developing for it!"
"#01155","This console has a beautiful LCD screen and high capacity game discs./They're shipping it in large numbers, so I would suggest trying to get a license."
"#01156","This unusual portable console has a touch screen and a stylus./They must be targeting children and families if they plan on shipping so many of them."
"#01157","This one doesn't even look like a game console!/The optional “TP Controller” seems quite popular."
"#01158","This console can apparently even explore the reaches of outer space!/I'm not sure how it is as a game console though..."
